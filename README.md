# text-analyzer
Parses a body of text, analyzes the text, and returns a body of text similar to the original using a basic word prediction array and a bit of randomization.

The file TextCreator.py contains the main method. A few sample txt files are provided, although any may be used. The txt file AllTrumpSpeeches.txt was originally obtained from ryanmcdermott on GitHub.
